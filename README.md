## Overview

> Sourdough bread is made with flour, water, and starter. Starter is a live wild yeast that's made out of flour, water, and air. Unfortunately, if starter is not fed (with water and flour) regularly, it will not activate and we won't be able to make bread. And if we neglect it long enough, then, it'll die. That's why I made a text message reminder so I don't forget to feed my starter!

Language: JavaScript

Products: Azure Functions Timer Trigger, Visual Studio Code, Twilio SMS

## Prerequisites

### Sign up for Microsoft Azure account

We'll use a [free Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) to set up our Timer trigger function.

### Sign up for Twilio and get a phone number.

We'll use [Twilio's free trial](www.twilio.com/referral/QYHnll) so we can get a number and use Twilio's API to text ourselves.

### Download Visual Studio Code and the Azure Extension

We'll use the [Azure extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/extensions) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to create your function and deploy our code to our Azure portla.
